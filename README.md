# Learning-Curve
The project is made for the newbies who is new to programming and don't know where to start with... and here where my project(learning curve) helps to newbies... 
They will understand what is programming languages, developments, etc
They will be redirected to the resources to learn by just clicking the buttons...
In this project we had provided 3 types of resources
1. Documentations
2. Video Resources
3. Best Courses to learn

So the students can choose any of the resources they are comfortable with and can learn accordingly...
Hoping to add more contents in this project in the future
